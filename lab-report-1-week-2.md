* Download VSCode 

___

![vscodeDownload](vscodeDownload.PNG)
    For this step, go to [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and download VSCode for whatever OS you have.
    Once you have downloaded VSCode you should be able to open it to a window that looks like this.

Click on the link that is related to the class you are in. For this class it is the one that starts cs15l as shown in the picture.

If this is your first time using this account, it will show something else where it says change password, and you will need to set a password or tell it to use your normal password for the new ieng6 account.

* Use VSCode to Remotely connect to the server

___
For this step you will want to open a terminal in VSCode and type in `ssh cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` where you replace the zz for the 3 letters in your personal account. Once you type this in you should be prompted with a line to enter your password.

It will look like nothing is being typed, but if you enter your password correctly you will be signed in and get a message that looks like this.

* Try Some Commands While Logged Into SSH

___
While you're logged into SSH you can try commands and see that they run on the server you're connected to.

* Learn to Move Files With scp

___
Using scp, you are able to move files from your computer (the client) to a remote computer (the server). As you can see in the screenshot, we can send a file to the server and then log into the server and run it from there.

* Expediting the process

___
As you can see it takes a while to send your files to the Server then connect and run them. This process can be expedited using an SSH Key. An SSH Key is a way connect your computer to the server without having to type in your password every time you want to connect. To set one up you follow this link [SSH Key for windows] https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement#user-key-generation.
On this page follow the steps in your VSCode terminal until your page looks like this

___

Once you have created your key, you must send one to the remote server. To do that you need to go to the remote server, create a folder for the key to go, and then send your key to the remote server from the client.

* Optimizing Remote Running

___
Once you no longer have to login to access the remote server every single time there are several ways to more quickly edit a file on the remote server. 
1. You can write a command in quotes to directly run it on the home directory of the remote server. ![Shortcuts1](Shortcuts1.PNG)
2. You can send multiple commands at the same time using semicolons. ![Shortcuts2](Shortcuts2.PNG)

* Using these strategies, it takes much less time, and far fewer keystrokes in order to save and run a file on a remote server. The first time I try to run javac and java on the remote server, it takes 52 keystrokes (mostly because I have a long password, and had to type out the command both times), but with these shortcuts, and copy paste it only takes 26 keystrokes. (this is longer than it should take because I have set a password for my key that is 17 keystrokes). Once I have made my password copy/pastable it goes down to 12 keystrokes, which is significantyl less than the 52 that I started with.
